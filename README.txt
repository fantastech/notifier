= About WANotifier.com =

WANotifier.com is one of the world's first and only FREE SaaS tool that allows you to **send unlimited WhatsApp broadcast messages** and **transactional notifications** (like WooCommerce order notifications) using WhatsApp's official [Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/overview)!

WhatsApp recently launched its Cloud API to let businesses send WhatsApp messages to customer using their official API. Before this if you had to send bulk WhatsApp messages or notifications, there were only two ways to do it:

1. You either used **hack-y browser extensions or desktop / mobile apps** that would work on top of WhatsApp Web or your WhatsApp phone app to send the messages in a *shady* and [unauthorized](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1104252539917581/) way. This was a good way to get your phone number **banned** by WhatsApp!

2. Or, you had to sign up with one of the WhatsApp approved **Business Service Providers** and pay them high monthly fees to use their software to send messages. Not only you had to pay high monthly fees, they even charged you a premium of 10â€“15% on top of WhatsApp API's [conversation-based pricing](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing/).

But that changes with WANotifier.com!

Now you can send the bulk broadcast messages and transactional notifications using the **official WhatsApp way** but without needing to pay for a costly middle-ware SaaS tools. WANotifier.com uses **WhatsApp's official Cloud API** and acts as a FREE bridge between you and WhatsApp to send messages without limitation or charging you a premium on top of their per conversation cost. You settle your billing directly with them!

*Note:* WhatsApp Cloud API allows you to **send upto 1,000 messages for FREE per month**. After that WhatsApp charges you a small fees per conversation as [shown here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing/).

If you're looking for a **safe, cost friendly and robust** solution for sending WhatsApp broadcasts or messages, this tool is for you!
