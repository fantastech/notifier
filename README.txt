== About WANotifier.com ==

WANotifier.com is a WhatsApp marketing SaaS tool that allows you to **send WhatsApp broadcast messages** and **transactional notifications** from your website using [WhatsApp's official API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/overview)!

WhatsApp provides API to let businesses send WhatsApp messages to their customers using their APIs.

Earlier, if you had to send WhatsApp messages or notifications, there were only two ways to do it:

1. You either used **hack-y browser extensions or desktop / mobile apps** that would work on top of WhatsApp Web or your WhatsApp phone app to send the messages in a *shady* and [unauthorized](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1104252539917581/) way. This was a good way to get your phone number **banned** by WhatsApp!

2. Or, you had to sign up with one of the WhatsApp approved **Business Service Providers (BSPs)**, who acted like brokers between you and WhatsApp, and you had to pay them high monthly fees to use APIs. Not only you had to pay high monthly fees, they even charged you a premium of 15–20% on top of WhatsApp API's [conversation-based pricing](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing/).

**But that changes with WANotifier.com!**

Now you can send the bulk broadcast messages and transactional notifications using the **official WhatsApp way** but without needing to pay a fortune to the middlemen BSPs.

WANotifier.com uses **WhatsApp's official API** and acts as a simple bridge between you and WhatsApp to send messages without limitation or charging you a premium on top of their per conversation cost. You settle your API usage billing directly with them!

**Note: WhatsApp API is paid API. They charge you a small fees per conversation as [shown here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing/) that you need to settle with them directly on their portal.**

If you're looking for a **cost friendly and robust** solution for sending WhatsApp broadcasts or messages, this tool is for you!
