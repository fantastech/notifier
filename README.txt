Send WhatsApp notifications to your Woocommerce customers using WhatsApp's official Cloud API for small businesses.

== Description ==

Send order related WhatsApp notifications to your Woocommerce customers using WhatsApp's official Cloud API for small businesses. 

No sign up required with any 3rd party WhatsApp Business Service Providers. This is a self-hosted free WordPress plugin that uses WhatsApp's recently launched Cloud API to allow you to send notification messages to your customers on WhatsApp from within WordPress.

All you need to do is setup your Meta (Facebook) Developers account, create an app for WhatsApp Cloud API using your phone number and put the credentials in the plugin. That's all and you're ready to go!

**IMPORTANT NOTES**

*   You need to setup your phone number with WhatsApp Business account to be able to use this plugin.
*   Once you setup your phone number with WhatsApp Business account you will not be able to use the number in the WhatsApp Business mobile app.
*   If you're already using your phone number on your WhatsApp Business app, you'll need to delete the account which will delete all the previous chat history. Make sure to backup your chat before you decide to use the number for this plugin. You can also choose to use a different number just for these notifications 
*   This plugin is in early development stage so it only allows you to send message templates. You won't be able to send custom text messages or receive customer replies using this plugin as of now. This can be restrictive to some businesses who use their WhatsApp number for communication with customers. If this is you, we suggest not downloading this plugin and coming back later when we add Inbox feature to the plugin to manage chat. 
*   Before you can send the Message Templates to your customers, those needs to be approved by Facebook first. You can create your own message templates from within the plugin's settings page. The plugin sends these templates to Facebook for approval. Once the template is approved, you can use it to send notification to your customer.
